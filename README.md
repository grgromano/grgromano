# Hi there üëã

Nice to meet you! I'm Giorgio Romano, Mathematical Engineer from Politecnico di Milano. I am passionate about the world of Artificial Intelligence and, more specifically, about Statistical Learning. I am truly fascinated by the disruptive potential of this technology and eager to contribute to the transformation that it will bring to our everyday lives.

## üéì Education
- Master of Science: Mathematical Engineering, Statistical Learning @ Politecnico di Milano
- Erasmus+ Program @ Aalto University, Helsinki - Department of Computer Science
- Bachelor of Science: Mathematical Engineering @ Politecnico di Milano

## üõ†Ô∏è Some interesting projects
- [Model Discovery integrating Symbolic Regression into Sparse Identification of Nonlinear Dynamics](https://github.com/grgromano/MD-Loop): A novel Model Discovery approach, able to mitigate existing methods‚Äô limitations ‚Äì namely: computational efficiency, flexibility and level of automation ‚Äì while extending Model Discovery scope in the contexts of Online Model Discovery and Reduced Order Modeling
- [Plant's Health Status Classifier](https://github.com/grgromano/image-classifier): exploited Deep Neural Networks to perform Image Classification, leveraging pre-trained Convolutional Neural Networks through transfer learning. 
- [Time Series Forecasting Project](https://github.com/grgromano/timeseries-forecasting): exploited Recursive Neural Networks to perform Time Series Forecasting, leveraging LSTM, GRU and Attention Mechanism architectures.
- [Online Learning for E-commerce Pricing and Advertising Optimization](https://github.com/grgromano/Online-PricingAdvertising): applied multi-armed bandit algorithms to optimize pricing and advertising strategies in dynamic environments.
